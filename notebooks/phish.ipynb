      "Weekapaug contained Super Bad teases by Trey. Just before the third set began, four vaudeville singers came onto the stage, and had Trey make a wish. He wished the band could do all of the past 40 years all over again. A time machine was then revealed, next to Mike on stage, and the cube above began to show various years. Various characters from past NYE gags came out; mostly NYE gags, until a wombat came out and broke the time machine. All of the remaining gags were represented with dancers. The first Ghost contained Meatstick lyrics and the Bohemian Rhapsody, which featured a choir on stage, also contained a Ghost quote from Page. The band ate cake at the New Year, and during Wilson balls were tossed out into the crowd (with Trey's platform descending prior to that, and the clone figure that was on the platform turned into Tom Hanks). Carini had people in \"naked dude suits\" running around on stage with security trying to catch them. The naked dudes did a live dance during New York New York.\n"
